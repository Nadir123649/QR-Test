# Frontend Developer Skills Test

## Project Overview

This project is designed to test frontend developer skills through the implementation of a mobile-responsive interface with specific UI/UX requirements. The project involves creating a mobile layout with a sticky QR code preview and horizontal scrolling template selection.

## Design Reference

The project is based on a Figma design (see `Screenshot_1.png` for reference). The design shows a mobile interface that needs to be implemented with specific functionality requirements.

## Requirements

### Task 1: Sticky QR Code Preview

**Objective:** Introduce a sticky QR code preview at the top of the mobile view.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Preview is sticky at the top of the mobile layout
- Sticky preview maintains a fixed height regardless of which frame is used

**Technical Requirements:**
- The QR code preview should remain visible at the top of the screen when scrolling
- The preview should have a consistent height across different template frames
- Should be responsive and work on various mobile screen sizes

### Task 2: Horizontal Scrolling Template Selection

**Objective:** Refactor the template or frames selection to support horizontal scrolling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Template list scrolls horizontally on mobile
- Touch/swipe interaction works

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement smooth horizontal scrolling for template selection
- Support touch/swipe gestures for navigation
- Ensure proper mobile touch interaction
- Maintain accessibility standards

## Technical Specifications

### Mobile-First Approach
- Design should be mobile-first with responsive considerations
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized for mobile viewport

### Browser Support
- Modern mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet)
- Touch event support required
- CSS Grid/Flexbox support

### Performance Considerations
- Smooth scrolling performance
